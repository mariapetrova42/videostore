Videostore Simulation Database

Requirements
Phase 3 Deliverable must contain the goal of this phase of the project, and a description of the creation 
of the database schema and instance and of the application programs. It must also provide any revisions 
made to the specifications described in Phase 2 Deliverable. It must further describe the problems 
encountered in Phase 3 and justify the solutions. 

• The program must run 
• Make sure you have ample sample data in your tables so that you can sufficiently perform and 
illustrate all required tasks. 
• You do not have to design a fancy GUI (your interface can be menu-driven.) 


1. Run SQL commands for creating tables including primary keys, secondary keys and foreign 
keys. Run SQL command files that populate each table. Each table is required to have a 
sufficient number of tuples. Keep in mind the relationships between tables, and plan your data 
accordingly. You should be able to run these command files successfully with no errors and no 
integrity violations. 

You are to develop a menu driven application system for the public library system database. The 
following are the menus to be developed. Try to implement all applications described below. If you 
want you may add more functions and menus. If you miss a task mention which one. In this case if 
you have implemented a task with a similar functionality mention it. 

1. Main menu: 
• Customer functions (ask for card number/userID, and then show sub-menu). 
• Administrative Functions (ask for ID and password, and then show submenu). 
• Quit.

2. Customer Functions Submenu: 
• Search a Movie by category, title, or director name. 
• Movie checkout. 
• Movie return. 
• Movie reserve. 
• Compute fine for a movie copy checked out by a customer based on the current date. 
• Print the list of movies reserved by a customer and their status. 
• Print the movie ids and movie titles of movies directed by a director. 
• Quit (Log out). 

3. Administrative Functions Menu: 
• Add a movie copy. 
• Search a movie and check the status of its copies.
• Add new customer.

• Print top 10 most frequent renters in a store and the number of movies each has rented. 
• Print top 10 most rented movies in a store. 
• Print the 10 most popular movies of the year. 
• Find the average fine paid per customer. 
• Quit (Log out)


What is expected in your submission: 
1. Description of implementation, problems faced. 
2. The SQL commands that create your tables 
3. The SQL commands that populate your tables (Or, you could give an export)
4. The php source code. 
5. A few screenshots of the major screens.


Put 1, 2 in a single Docx or PDF file and 3,4 as a text file. The PHP folder should be given as 
one ZIP.

And apart from the group submission, there should be
6. An individual submission that states what the different group members including you did
