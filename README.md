VideoStore Project
Maria Petrova, Sakeena Younus, Dora Baciu

ABOUT
This project is meant to model a videostore, with a structure similar to a library. The backend is written with SQL using XAMPP and the frontend is written with a PHP/HTML/CSS. 

For more details, see implementation-info.txt. 


FUTURE WORK
As seen in implementation-info, there are still many details that need to be updated or fixed. The deadline for this version of the project required a lot of simplifications, which were not ideal. A better version of this project, starting from the ground up with the initial database design, is currently in the works and will be posted once functional.
